**DO NOT PLAGIARIZE**


## Submission Generation

Make sure that you have the required Rubygems:

```
   cd helpers && bundle install
```

Change the `base_dir` variable to whatever package format you're using in `generate_submission.rb`:

```ruby
  # THIS LINE HERE 
  base_dir = '../src/mem/kbrleson'
```

Run the main bash script from the root directory:

```
  submit.sh
```
